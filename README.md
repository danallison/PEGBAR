\*PEG\*BAR\*
========

PEGBAR is software for creating hand drawn animation using HTML5 Canvas. Export formats include .gif (via [gif.js](https://github.com/jnordberg/gif.js)) and ... uh ... that's it. I hope to create a .png sprite file export in the future. Actually, there's a lot of features I'd like to add in the future, and a lot of bugs I'd like to fix, UX improvements, etc.
